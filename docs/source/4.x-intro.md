# What's new in Gluu Server v4

## Version 4.1

### OIDC client creation improvements

In version 4.1, we fixed several issues with OpenID Connect clients that were causing early expiration and errors with attributes.

### Shibboleth IDP cache support
Shibboleth IDP user sessions are now cached similarly to other services, allowing them to survive server restarts and be more easily replicated in a clustered environment. See more details in the [IDP documentation](./admin-guide/saml.md#idp-cache-support)

### Casa and oxd added to installation script
For convenience, [Casa](https://gluu.org/docs/casa) and [oxd](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd) can now be installed with the standard Community Edition setup script! See all the options in the [setup script documentation](./installation-guide/setup_py.md).

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements

A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.6/release-notes/#changes).

## Version 4.0

### Persistence redesign
In 4.0, the Gluu Server persistence layer is more modular. Previously LDAP was tightly bundled. Now, any persistence mechanism can be supported with a jar file that implements the base Persistence API. The desired mechanism can then be specifed in `gluu.properties`. [Learn more](./reference/persistence.md).   

### Support for Couchbase 
Couchbase Enterprise Edition (EE) is now supported as a persistence mechanism, enabling hyper-scalable authentication and authorization. [Learn more](https://gluu.org/docs/cb). 

### Extensive Passport redesign
New UI's in 4.0 enable simpler configuration of inbound identity workflows and improved support for external OpenID Connect Providers ("inbound OpenID"). [Read the docs](./authn-guide/passport.md).

### No version numbers in packages
Previously, the version number was included in the Gluu Server package, e.g. `gluu-server-3.1.6`. Starting in 4.0, the latest stable Gluu Server package name is simply `gluu-server`. This simplifies version upgrades, server operations, and improves interoperability between Gluu products.

### More SAML IDP features
NameIDs can now be [configured inside oxTrust](./admin-guide/saml.md#configure-nameid-in-oxtrust), and [SAML ACRS parameters](./admin-guide/saml.md#authncontextclassref-support) are now supported, which, when used in conjunction with [force authentication](./admin-guide/saml.md#force-authentication), enables stepped-up authentication for SAML SPs. 

### Support for RADIUS authentication
The Gluu Server now supports two options for RADIUS authentication to enable SSO and 2FA to non-web applications like SSH, VPN, and Wi-Fi: 

- [Gluu RADIUS](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radius.md): a free, single-threaded RADIUS implementation based on the TinyRADIUS server; and...  

- [Radiator](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radiator.md): a robust, commercial AAA server built for ISPs and carriers.

### Improved clean up service
Introduced in CE 3.1.6, `cleanService` is now more configurable. This service periodically removes unused and expired cache and session-related database entries to improve server performance. [Read the docs](./operation/cleanup.md).

### Updated libraries and components 
4.0 includes the latest version of Shibboleth, updated Java libraries and Jetty, and Oracle JDK has been replaced with Amazon Corretto, an open source, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. 

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements
A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.0/release-notes/#changes).
