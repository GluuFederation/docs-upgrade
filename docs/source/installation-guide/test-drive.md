# Test Drive Demo

## Overview

Follow the instructions below to quickly deploy a single-node Gluu Server demo using Docker. 

!!! Note
    "Test drive" is perfect for *testing* the Gluu Server. For production deployments, follow instructions for your [OS of choice](./index.md#supported-operating-systems), e.g. [Docker](./install-docker.md).  

## Requirements

### Linux Requirements

For Docker deployments on Linux, provision a VM with: 

- The minimum system requirements, as described in the [VM Preparation Guide](../installation-guide/index.md#system-requirements). 

- Both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) installed. 

### OS X (Mac) Requirements

For Docker deployments on OS X, make sure you have the following:

- The minimum [system requirements](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) 

- Allow file sharing. Go to docker preferences, add the folder path to file sharing and restart docker. [Read the docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces) 

## Instructions

1. Log in as root:

    ```
    sudo su -
    ```

1. Obtain the files for deployment:
    
```
wget https://github.com/GluuFederation/community-edition-containers/archive/4.1.zip \
    && unzip 4.1.zip
```

```
cd community-edition-containers-4.1/examples/single-host
```   

```
chmod +x run_all.sh
```

1.  Run the following command and follow the prompts:

    ```
    ./run_all.sh
    ```
    
    Do not be alarmed about the `warning` alerts that may show up. Wait until it prompts you for information or loads the previous configuration found. If this is a fresh install, the output will look like this :

    
    ```
    ./run_all.sh

    The startup process may take some time. You can keep track of the deployment by using the following command:
    
    ```
    ./run_all.sh logs -f
    ```
    
## Uninstall the Gluu demo

To remove all deployed objects, run the following command inside `community-edition-containers-4.1.0/examples/single-host`: 
    
    ```
    ./run_all.sh down
    ```
